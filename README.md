This repository includes all homeworks, study guides, lecture notes, and other miscellaneous files I created for this course.

It is intended as a REFERENCE only and as helpful tool for future students who may take this class after me.

Dr. Pollett is an exceptionally knowledge, friendly, and approachable professor.  I highly recommend him and his course
to all students who are serious about learning.  While his course is not easy and requires a significant time investment in 
order to do well, in the end, it is more than worth it.
